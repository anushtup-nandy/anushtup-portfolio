            <h3>Last semester and MS applications :</h3>
            <p>
              I'm in my last semester (4th year Sem-2) and having done my internship last semester,
              I am only left with 2 courses before I can graduate..... or so I thought. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Turns out, doing a thesis internship makes you eligible for graduating early!
              Somehow, no one (including myself) bothered to look into this. I could have just 
              not gone on campus stayed back and rested at my home, or done another internship....

              But still being the overenthusiastic and workaholic, I chose to work in my lab (WITHOUT funding!)
              rather than rest at home.

              Coming to my master's admissions..... I was left with some of my applications such as 
              Columbia and Texas A&M. 

              Most of my rejections had also started coming! I got rejected from Stanford, MIT, UCB, 
              University of Michigan Ann Arbor Purdue. Even after such a successful thesis at CMU, I got rejected
              from their Robotics Program (part of it was because I applied to their PhD). Then I got rejected from
              CMU's PhD in Mech but still got into the MS program (without funding! againnnnn).
              At this moment, I was fed up with the BioRobotics Lab. It had taught me so much and I had a very thrilling time
              there, but still it didn't pan out much. 

              I only got acceptances from UPenn and Columbia, and after some moderately careful consideration.... I chose 
              Columbia!!
